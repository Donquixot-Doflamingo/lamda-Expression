# Lambda Basics 📖
In this repository i learnt about the need of lambda expression and how one can move from imperative style of programming to functional type of programming.

* ### Imperative programming 👴🏻
    It is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem.

* ### Functional programming 🆕
    It is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”.

## Brief of what is learnt.

#### NOTE -: Different approaches to a same solution is used in the project.


* ### Approach 1 - Imperative style 👴🏻
    Two functions name "printPersonOlderThan" and "printPersonWithinAgeRange" are made.
* ### Approach 2 - Functional Style 🆕
  Four approaches are used here which are listed below.
* * #### Approach 2.1 - Using custom Class and interface 
    Here the custom class "CheckEligibleForSelectiveSearch" and interface "CheckPerson" is used to implement the given program.
* * #### Approach 2.2 - Using anonymous Class and custom interface
  Here the class is defines anonymously and interface "CheckPerson" is directly implemented in it. 
* * #### Approach 2.3 - Using lambda expression with custom-built functional interface
  Here the lambda function is used by the help of functional interface. The code is written in very short and in a very functional manner.
* * #### Approach 2.4 - Using lambda expression with default functional interface called predicate
    Here the same lambda function is made just without declaring any built in custom interface rather than a simple predicate interface is used.
